# In-N-Out

> **In-N-Out** is a web application that displays different cryptocurrencies on/off ramping solutions.

There are plenty of solutions to go into and out of cryptocurrencies out there, but it is often hard to find the good one, depending on *what country* we live in, *what currency* we use, and *what payment method* we prefer. 

**In-N-Out** helps you find the one that suits you the best.

## Why

This project was created after many requests from DAOs that needs to be funded with fiat and also where members need to withdraw in fiat, notably in projects helping to fight COVID-19 which connects donators and volunteers.
